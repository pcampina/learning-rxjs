Imagine that you’re working on an Angular application and need to call an API for a to-do list, shopping cart, or weather app data. Whatever the number of APIs you’re using, you need a way to manage them. RxJS can help. When you learn RxJS, you’ll be working with an industry standard library that seamlessly works with any Angular application to manage APIs and data. In this course, front-end software engineer Alex Nguyen gives you an introduction to RxJS that will get you started on building Angular applications that scale to handle data from anywhere. Learn key RxJS concepts, including exactly what an observable is. Find out how to use RxJS to create and subscribe to observables and leverage subjects—a specialized type of observable—for fine-grained control. Plus, explore ways to use RxJS with multiple observables.
